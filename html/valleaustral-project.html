        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p class="research-text">Valle Austral needed user touchpoints for them to collect information about the product.
            Also they didn’t have a strong and concrete visual identity and could not communicate clearly.

    <div class="research-container">
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p class="research-text">Creating a concept that could describe the wine and connect emotionally with the audience and communicate it through user touchpoints, in this case, the creation of a website.

        <h2>The Process</h2>
    
        <div class="research-container">
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p class="research-text">I investigated competitive websites of other wines from the region that are also exported to extract significant UI Components and with it create in an atomic way, from really tiny to a big masterpiece, to show how the design language could apply to the user interface without interfering in user experience but adding significance to it. 
            After reviewing different existing websites and audience types I developed recommendations on Information Architecture and User Experience, what the site should have, how it should communicate and how it should interact with the possible clients.

        <h3>Design for performance & pleasant aesthetics.
        </h3>
        <p class="concept-text">In every project, I’m daily  balancing aesthetics and performance. For this site, this was easy. I believe that a good user experience starts with delivering content as fast as possible. And that experience can be enhanced with a good story to tell and extraordinary graphics and imagery. That means performance and aesthetics go hand in hand with each other. One should not choose one over the other but make them flow together.
            Good content, layout, images, and interactivity are essential for engaging your audience, one without the other can be seen as incomplete or low cost. In every step of the design and development, I looked at how I could get a nice user experience and design while having an excellent impact on performance.

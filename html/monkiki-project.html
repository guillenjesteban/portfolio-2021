        <div class="solution-wrapper">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>I developed a cohesive and coherent branding and design both for web and app using Adobe tools. I also could build, develop and deploy in React the landing page.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="web-container">
        <h3>Landing Page</h3>
        <div class="web-info-container">
        <div class="web-text-container"><p>The website integrates more video content and information like benefits for vets and animal shelters. I created illustrations and selected the colors of the branding book to keep creating a visual system. It also contains the different policies of the app.</p>

    <div class="phone-container">
        <h3>App Design</h3>
        <p class="phone-text">The design of the app focuses on delivering a user center experience, where you have a more interactive element that can help you find your new pet or give your current one up for adoption.
            It represents the color of the branding board and has a cohesive design that respects the brand system.</p>

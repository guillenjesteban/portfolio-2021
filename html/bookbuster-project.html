        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>I developed a cohesive and coherent branding and applied UI design with UX patterns to facilitate the journey of the user.</p>
        </div>


    <div class="phone-container">
        <h3>App Design</h3>
        <p class="phone-text">The design of the app focuses on delivering a user center experience, where you have a more interactive element that can help you find that book you wanted or suggest new books to rent nearby.
            It represents the color of the branding board and has a cohesive design that respects the brand system. The UX Principles applied make a better and more fluid experience for the user.</p>
